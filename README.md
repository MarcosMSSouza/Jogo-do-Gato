# Jogo-do-Gato

Build 3.0.

- Lots of improvements to the interface, and some minor tweaking to the script.

The 'logical' aspect of this project wasn't that hard, but I've learned a lot of CSS and Html in order to build something so simple like this. I've got some beatings, but the knowledge learned will stay!!
