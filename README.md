# Jogo-do-Gato

Build 2.0.

This should be at least the 4.0 Build, but I was focused on finishing the project and so I forgot to keep uploading them. Right now I don't think I'll need to make further changes to the project, so this is probably the final version.

- A lot of mprovements since the first upload were made to the logic of the game, and most of all, the UI. I'm very happy with the final result.
